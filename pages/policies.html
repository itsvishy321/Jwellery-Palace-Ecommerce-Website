                        violates the rights of a third party; or (iii) protect the rights, property or personal safety

                        information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to
                        perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including
                        policies and procedures designed to protect your information. All of our service providers

                        be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Jewellery

                        a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AND Jewellery Palace AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE
                        OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN

                        granted herein. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable
                        purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement shall govern and supersede any
